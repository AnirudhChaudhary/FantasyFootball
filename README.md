Issue: 
- FanDuel hosts competitions for players to create their own superteam given a budget. Each user is allowed a fixed number of entries into the competitions and winners get cash prizes.

Project:
There are two components to this project:
  1. Predict the number of points a player will get in a given game based on multiple factors like:
    a. Home / Away
    b. Offense / Defense
    c. Surrounding Players
    d. Performance in previous weeks
    e. Strength of opposition
    
  2. Given players with projected points and a given salary, create a lineup of players that are optimized based on salary and points predicted.
  
 Currently: working on step number 2. Step number 1 involves machine learning and will be attacked once the optimization is complete.
