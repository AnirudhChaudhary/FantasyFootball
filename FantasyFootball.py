#Fantasy Football

"""
Current Objective:

2. Need to consider players based off of their positions as well. Perhaps this could be done by creating another variable in the battlefield class
that represents what players have already been picked. You could optimize player selection to only cases where you would actually need that player

Notes: Perhaps need to change how classes work and interact with one another

Player Class: handles all methods related to players regarding cost, position, value and name
Battlefield Class: handles what players we have chosen and what positions they inhabit
Analytics Class: Takes in a list of players and the battlefield that we have and finds the best path with the players available and battlefield

Be able to take a list of players, their costs, and their values and construct a list of players that are most optimal

Future Objectives:
1. Incorporate multipliers for players that we think are going to perform exceptionally well. This would be another case to add to the "dynamic program"
For every player we consider adding the player as a normal player, adding as a multiplied player, or not adding the player



3. Need to make the test case situation much better. Create a better framework for the way that I create tests. Need to make assertions rather than
just print statements.
